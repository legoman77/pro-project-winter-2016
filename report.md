# SkilStak Pro Final Report - Winter 2016

This project is a calculator that simulates battles from the Fire Emblem video game series.  The project ended up being more difficult than I expected, but also more fun.  In the end, I was able to create a working battle simulation that is both helpful and fun.

## Lessons Learned

If I could do this project again, I would try to shorten my code.  From this experience, I have learned to make better use of functions and lists.

## Next Steps

The next thing I would like to do with this projet is to add more advanced battle components, such as weapon effects and skills.
